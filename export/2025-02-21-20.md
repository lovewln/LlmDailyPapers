- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences, yet efficiently serving these long-context models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.





## Aligning LLMs to Ask Good Questions A Case Study in Clinical Reasoning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14860v1
- **Authors**: ['Shuyue Stella Li', 'Jimin Mun', 'Faeze Brahman', 'Jonathan S. Ilgen', 'Yulia Tsvetkov', 'Maarten Sap']
- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to ask effective questions under uncertainty, making them unreliable in domains where proactive information-gathering is essential for decisionmaking. We present ALFA, a framework that improves LLM question-asking by (i) decomposing the notion of a "good" question into a set of theory-grounded attributes (e.g., clarity, relevance), (ii) controllably synthesizing attribute-specific question variations, and (iii) aligning models via preference-based optimization to explicitly learn to ask better questions along these fine-grained attributes. Focusing on clinical reasoning as a case study, we introduce the MediQ-AskDocs dataset, composed of 17k real-world clinical interactions augmented with 80k attribute-specific preference pairs of follow-up questions, as well as a novel expert-annotated interactive healthcare QA task to evaluate question-asking abilities. Models aligned with ALFA reduce diagnostic errors by 56.6% on MediQ-AskDocs compared to SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs, with a question-level win-rate of 64.4% and strong generalizability. Our findings suggest that explicitly guiding question-asking with structured, fine-grained attributes offers a scalable path to improve LLMs, especially in expert application domains.





## FR-Spec: Accelerating Large-Vocabulary Language Models via Frequency-Ranked Speculative Sampling

- **Abstrat**: Speculative sampling has emerged as an important technique for accelerating the auto-regressive generation process of large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a draft-then-verify mechanism to produce multiple tokens per forward pass. While state-of-the-art speculative sampling methods use only a single layer and a language modeling (LM) head as the draft model to achieve impressive layer compression, their efficiency gains are substantially reduced for large-vocabulary LLMs, such as Llama-3-8B with a vocabulary of 128k tokens. To address this, we present FR-Spec, a frequency-ranked speculative sampling framework that optimizes draft candidate selection through vocabulary space compression. By constraining the draft search to a frequency-prioritized token subset, our method reduces LM Head computation overhead by 75% while ensuring the equivalence of the final output distribution. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate an average of 1.12$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art speculative sampling method EAGLE-2.





## Prompt-to-Leaderboard
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14855v1
- **Authors**: ['Evan Frick', 'Connor Chen', 'Joseph Tennyson', 'Tianle Li', 'Wei-Lin Chiang', 'Anastasios N. Angelopoulos', 'Ion Stoica']
- **Abstrat**: Large language model (LLM) evaluations typically rely on aggregated metrics like accuracy or human preference, averaging across users and prompts. This averaging obscures user- and prompt-specific variations in model performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Leaderboard (P2L), a method that produces leaderboards specific to a prompt. The core idea is to train an LLM taking natural language prompts as input to output a vector of Bradley-Terry coefficients which are then used to predict the human preference vote. The resulting prompt-dependent leaderboards allow for unsupervised task-specific evaluation, optimal routing of queries to models, personalization, and automated evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses. Data from Chatbot Arena suggest that P2L better captures the nuanced landscape of language model performance than the averaged leaderboard. Furthermore, our findings suggest that P2L's ability to produce prompt-specific evaluations follows a power law scaling similar to that observed in LLMs themselves. In January 2025, the router we trained based on this methodology achieved the \#1 spot in the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. Our code is available at this GitHub link: https://github.com/lmarena/p2l.





## GATE: Graph-based Adaptive Tool Evolution Across Diverse Tasks

- **Authors**: ['Jianwen Luo', 'Yiming Huang', 'Jinxiang Meng', 'Fangyu Lei', 'Shizhu He', 'Xiao Liu', 'Shanshan Jiang', 'Bin Dong', 'Jun Zhao', 'Kang Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in tool-making, yet existing frameworks often struggle to efficiently construct reliable toolsets and are limited to single-task settings. To address these challenges, we propose GATE (Graph-based Adaptive Tool Evolution), an adaptive framework that dynamically constructs and evolves a hierarchical graph of reusable tools across multiple scenarios. We evaluate GATE on open-ended tasks (Minecraft), agent-based tasks (TextCraft, DABench), and code generation tasks (MATH, Date, TabMWP). Our results show that GATE achieves up to 4.3x faster milestone completion in Minecraft compared to the previous SOTA, and provides an average improvement of 9.23% over existing tool-making methods in code generation tasks and 10.03% in agent tasks. GATE demonstrates the power of adaptive evolution, balancing tool quantity, complexity, and functionality while maintaining high efficiency.

## Red-Teaming LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Communication Attacks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14847v1
- **Authors**: ['Pengfei He', 'Yupin Lin', 'Shen Dong', 'Han Xu', 'Yue Xing', 'Hui Liu']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have revolutionized complex problem-solving capability by enabling sophisticated agent collaboration through message-based communications. While the communication framework is crucial for agent coordination, it also introduces a critical yet unexplored security vulnerability. In this work, we introduce Agent-in-the-Middle (AiTM), a novel attack that exploits the fundamental communication mechanisms in LLM-MAS by intercepting and manipulating inter-agent messages. Unlike existing attacks that compromise individual agents, AiTM demonstrates how an adversary can compromise entire multi-agent systems by only manipulating the messages passing between agents. To enable the attack under the challenges of limited control and role-restricted communication format, we develop an LLM-powered adversarial agent with a reflection mechanism that generates contextually-aware malicious instructions. Our comprehensive evaluation across various frameworks, communication structures, and real-world applications demonstrates that LLM-MAS is vulnerable to communication-based attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in multi-agent systems.





## Scaling Text-Rich Image Understanding via Code-Guided Synthetic Multimodal Data Generation

- **Abstrat**: Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.





## Revealing and Mitigating Over-Attention in Knowledge Editing
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14838v1
- **Authors**: ['Pinzheng Wang', 'Zecheng Tang', 'Keyan Zhou', 'Juntao Li', 'Qiaoming Zhu', 'Min Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the edited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other pre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift phenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.





## Towards Efficient Optimizer Design for LLM via Structured Fisher Approximation with a Low-Rank Extension
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07752v2
- **Authors**: ['Wenbo Gong', 'Meyer Scetbon', 'Chao Ma', 'Edward Meeds']
- **Abstrat**: Designing efficient optimizers for large language models (LLMs) with low-memory requirements and fast convergence is an important and challenging problem. This paper makes a step towards the systematic design of such optimizers through the lens of structured Fisher information matrix (FIM) approximation. We show that many state-of-the-art efficient optimizers can be viewed as solutions to FIM approximation (under the Frobenius norm) with specific structural assumptions. Building on these insights, we propose two design recommendations of practical efficient optimizers for LLMs, involving the careful selection of structural assumptions to balance generality and efficiency, and enhancing memory efficiency of optimizers with general structures through a novel low-rank extension framework. We demonstrate how to use each design approach by deriving new memory-efficient optimizers: Row and Column Scaled SGD (RACS) and Adaptive low-dimensional subspace estimation (Alice). Experiments on LLaMA pre-training (up to 1B parameters) validate the effectiveness, showing faster and better convergence than existing memory-efficient baselines and Adam with little memory overhead. Notably, Alice achieves better than 2x faster convergence over Adam, while RACS delivers strong performance on the 1B model with SGD-like memory.





## LongWriter-V: Enabling Ultra-Long and High-Fidelity Generation in Vision-Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14834v1
- **Authors**: ['Shangqing Tu', 'Yucheng Wang', 'Daniel Zhang-Li', 'Yushi Bai', 'Jifan Yu', 'Yuhao Wu', 'Lei Hou', 'Huiqin Liu', 'Zhiyuan Liu', 'Bin Xu', 'Juanzi Li']
- **Abstrat**: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs. Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.

## MATS: An Audio Language Model under Text-only Supervision
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13433v2
- **Authors**: ['Wen Wang', 'Ruibing Hou', 'Hong Chang', 'Shiguang Shan', 'Xilin Chen']
- **Abstrat**: Large audio-language models (LALMs), built upon powerful Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable audio comprehension and reasoning capabilities. However, the training of LALMs demands a large corpus of audio-language pairs, which requires substantial costs in both data collection and training resources. In this paper, we propose MATS, an audio-language multimodal LLM designed to handle Multiple Audio task using solely Text-only Supervision. By leveraging pre-trained audio-language alignment models such as CLAP, we develop a text-only training strategy that projects the shared audio-language latent space into LLM latent space, endowing the LLM with audio comprehension capabilities without relying on audio data during training. To further bridge the modality gap between audio and language embeddings within CLAP, we propose the Strongly-related noisy text with audio (Santa) mechanism. Santa maps audio embeddings into CLAP language embedding space while preserving essential information from the audio input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MATS, despite being trained exclusively on text data, achieves competitive performance compared to recent LALMs trained on large-scale audio-language pairs.





## Middle-Layer Representation Alignment for Cross-Lingual Transfer in Fine-Tuned LLMs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14830v1
- **Authors**: ['Danni Liu', 'Jan Niehues']
- **Abstrat**: While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align).





## A Survey of Model Architectures in Information Retrieval

- **Abstrat**: This survey examines the evolution of model architectures in information retrieval (IR), focusing on two key aspects: backbone models for feature extraction and end-to-end system architectures for relevance estimation. The review intentionally separates architectural considerations from training methodologies to provide a focused analysis of structural innovations in IR systems.We trace the development from traditional term-based methods to modern neural approaches, particularly highlighting the impact of transformer-based models and subsequent large language models (LLMs). We conclude by discussing emerging challenges and future directions, including architectural optimizations for performance and scalability, handling of multimodal, multilingual data, and adaptation to novel application domains beyond traditional search paradigms.





## Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04370v3
- **Authors**: ['Tejaswini Pedapati', 'Amit Dhurandhar', 'Soumya Ghosh', 'Soham Dan', 'Prasanna Sattigeri']
- **Abstrat**: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.





## eC-Tab2Text: Aspect-Based Text Generation from e-Commerce Product Tables
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14820v1
- **Authors**: ['Luis Antonio Gutiérrez Guanilo', 'Mir Tafseer Nayeem', 'Cristian López', 'Davood Rafiei']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across diverse domains, yet their application in e-commerce remains underexplored due to a lack of domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce eC-Tab2Text, a novel dataset designed to capture the intricacies of e-commerce, including detailed product attributes and user-specific queries. Leveraging eC-Tab2Text, we focus on text generation from product tables, enabling LLMs to produce high-quality, attribute-specific product reviews from structured tabular data. Fine-tuned models were rigorously evaluated using standard Table2Text metrics, alongside correctness, faithfulness, and fluency assessments. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in generating contextually accurate reviews, highlighting the transformative potential of tailored datasets and fine-tuning methodologies in optimizing e-commerce workflows. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in e-commerce workflows and the essential role of domain-specific datasets in tailoring them to industry-specific challenges.





## Dynamic Low-Rank Sparse Adaptation for Large Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14816v1
- **Authors**: ['Weizhong Huang', 'Yuxin Zhang', 'Xiawu Zheng', 'Yang Liu', 'Jing Lin', 'Yiwu Yao', 'Rongrong Ji']
- **Abstrat**: Despite the efficacy of network sparsity in alleviating the deployment strain of Large Language Models (LLMs), it endures significant performance degradation. Applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the sparse LLMs offers an intuitive approach to counter this predicament, while it holds shortcomings include: 1) The inability to integrate LoRA weights into sparse LLMs post-training, and 2) Insufficient performance recovery at high sparsity ratios. In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA), a novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs without increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically sparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during fine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the sparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual Information (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers, thereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during fine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based on the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an appropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies between dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can efficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without introducing any additional inferential burden. For example, LoSA reduced the perplexity of sparse LLaMA-2-7B by 68.73 and increased zero-shot accuracy by 16.32$\%$, achieving a 2.60$\times$ speedup on CPU and 2.23$\times$ speedup on GPU, requiring only 45 minutes of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU. Code is available at https://github.com/wzhuang-xmu/LoSA.





## FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis

- **Abstrat**: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.





## From RAG to Memory: Non-Parametric Continual Learning for Large Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14802v1
- **Authors**: ['Bernal Jiménez Gutiérrez', 'Yiheng Shu', 'Weijian Qi', 'Sizhe Zhou', 'Yu Su']
- **Abstrat**: Our ability to continuously acquire, organize, and leverage knowledge is a key feature of human intelligence that AI systems must approximate to unlock their full potential. Given the challenges in continual learning with large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the dominant way to introduce new information. However, its reliance on vector retrieval hinders its ability to mimic the dynamic and interconnected nature of human long-term memory. Recent RAG approaches augment vector embeddings with various structures like knowledge graphs to address some of these gaps, namely sense-making and associativity. However, their performance on more basic factual memory tasks drops considerably below standard RAG. We address this unintended deterioration and propose HippoRAG 2, a framework that outperforms standard RAG comprehensively on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. HippoRAG 2 builds upon the Personalized PageRank algorithm used in HippoRAG and enhances it with deeper passage integration and more effective online use of an LLM. This combination pushes this RAG system closer to the effectiveness of human long-term memory, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks over the state-of-the-art embedding model while also exhibiting superior factual knowledge and sense-making memory capabilities. This work paves the way for non-parametric continual learning for LLMs. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.





## Differentially Private Optimization for Non-Decomposable Objective Functions
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03104v2
- **Authors**: ['Weiwei Kong', 'Andrés Muñoz Medina', 'Mónica Ribero']
- **Abstrat**: Unsupervised pre-training is a common step in developing computer vision models and large language models. In this setting, the absence of labels requires the use of similarity-based loss functions, such as contrastive loss, that favor minimizing the distance between similar inputs and maximizing the distance between distinct inputs. As privacy concerns mount, training these models using differential privacy has become more important. However, due to how inputs are generated for these losses, one of their undesirable properties is that their $L_2$ sensitivity grows with the batch size. This property is particularly disadvantageous for differentially private training methods, such as DP-SGD. To overcome this issue, we develop a new DP-SGD variant for similarity based loss functions -- in particular, the commonly-used contrastive loss -- that manipulates gradients of the objective function in a novel way to obtain a sensitivity of the summed gradient that is $O(1)$ for batch size $n$. We test our DP-SGD variant on some CIFAR-10 pre-training and CIFAR-100 finetuning tasks and show that, in both tasks, our method's performance comes close to that of a non-private model and generally outperforms DP-SGD applied directly to the contrastive loss.





## A Multi-Agent Perspective on Modern Information Retrieval
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14796v1
- **Authors**: ['Haya Nachimovsky', 'Moshe Tennenholtz', 'Oren Kurland']
- **Abstrat**: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new era in information retrieval (IR), where queries and documents that were once assumed to be generated exclusively by humans can now also be created by automated agents. These agents can formulate queries, generate documents, and perform ranking. This shift challenges some long-standing IR paradigms and calls for a reassessment of both theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies. We advocate for a multi-agent perspective to better capture the complex interactions between query agents, document agents, and ranker agents. Through empirical exploration of various multi-agent retrieval settings, we reveal the significant impact of these interactions on system performance. Our findings underscore the need to revisit classical IR paradigms and develop new frameworks for more effective modeling and evaluation of modern retrieval systems.





## Humanoid-VLA: Towards Universal Humanoid Control with Visual Integration

- **Abstrat**: This paper addresses the limitations of current humanoid robot control frameworks, which primarily rely on reactive mechanisms and lack autonomous interaction capabilities due to data scarcity. We propose Humanoid-VLA, a novel framework that integrates language understanding, egocentric scene perception, and motion control, enabling universal humanoid control. Humanoid-VLA begins with language-motion pre-alignment using non-egocentric human motion datasets paired with textual descriptions, allowing the model to learn universal motion patterns and action semantics. We then incorporate egocentric visual context through a parameter efficient video-conditioned fine-tuning, enabling context-aware motion generation. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised data augmentation strategy that automatically generates pseudoannotations directly derived from motion data. This process converts raw motion sequences into informative question-answer pairs, facilitating the effective use of large-scale unlabeled video data. Built upon whole-body control architectures, extensive experiments show that Humanoid-VLA achieves object interaction and environment exploration tasks with enhanced contextual awareness, demonstrating a more human-like capacity for adaptive and intelligent engagement.





## Rapid Word Learning Through Meta In-Context Learning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14791v1
- **Authors**: ['Wentao Wang', 'Guangyuan Jiang', 'Tal Linzen', 'Brenden M. Lake']
- **Abstrat**: Humans can quickly learn a new word from a few illustrative examples, and then systematically and flexibly use it in novel contexts. Yet the abilities of current language models for few-shot word learning, and methods for improving these abilities, are underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel method, Meta-training for IN-context learNing Of Words (Minnow). This method trains language models to generate new examples of a word's usage given a few in-context examples, using a special placeholder token to represent the new word. This training is repeated on many new words to develop a general word-learning ability. We find that training models from scratch with Minnow on human-scale child-directed language enables strong few-shot word learning, comparable to a large language model (LLM) pre-trained on orders of magnitude more data. Furthermore, through discriminative and generative evaluations, we demonstrate that finetuning pre-trained LLMs with Minnow improves their ability to discriminate between new words, identify syntactic categories of new words, and generate reasonable new usages and definitions for new words, based on one or a few in-context examples. These findings highlight the data efficiency of Minnow and its potential to improve language model performance in word learning tasks.





## Dimensionality-Reduction Techniques for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: A Survey and Evaluation
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13491v2
- **Authors**: ['Zeyu Wang', 'Haoran Xiong', 'Qitong Wang', 'Zhenying He', 'Peng Wang', 'Themis Palpanas', 'Wei Wang']
- **Abstrat**: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on high-dimensional vectors has become a fundamental and essential component in various machine learning tasks. Recently, with the rapid development of deep learning models and the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), the dimensionality of the vectors keeps growing in order to accommodate a richer semantic representation. This poses a major challenge to the ANNS solutions since distance calculation cost in ANNS grows linearly with the dimensionality of vectors. To overcome this challenge, dimensionality-reduction techniques can be leveraged to accelerate the distance calculation in the search process. In this paper, we investigate six dimensionality-reduction techniques that have the potential to improve ANNS solutions, including classical algorithms such as PCA and vector quantization, as well as algorithms based on deep learning approaches. We further describe two frameworks to apply these techniques in the ANNS workflow, and theoretically analyze the time and space costs, as well as the beneficial threshold for the pruning ratio of these techniques. The surveyed techniques are evaluated on six public datasets. The analysis of the results reveals the characteristics of the different families of techniques and provides insights into the promising future research directions.





## Robin3D: Improving 3D Large Language Model via Robust Instruction Tuning
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00255v2
- **Authors**: ['Weitai Kang', 'Haifeng Huang', 'Yuzhang Shang', 'Mubarak Shah', 'Yan Yan']
- **Abstrat**: Recent advancements in 3D Large Language Models (3DLLMs) have highlighted their potential in building general-purpose agents in the 3D real world, yet challenges remain due to the lack of high-quality robust instruction-following data, leading to limited discriminative power and generalization of 3DLLMs. In this paper, we introduce Robin3D, a powerful 3DLLM trained on large-scale instruction-following data generated by our novel data engine, Robust Instruction Generation (RIG) engine. RIG generates two key instruction data: 1) the Adversarial Instruction-following data, which features mixed negative and positive samples to enhance the model's discriminative understanding. 2) the Diverse Instruction-following data, which contains various instruction styles to enhance model's generalization. As a result, we construct 1 million instruction-following data, consisting of 344K Adversarial samples, 508K Diverse samples, and 165K benchmark training set samples. To better handle these complex instructions, Robin3D first incorporates Relation-Augmented Projector to enhance spatial understanding, and then strengthens the object referring and grounding ability through ID-Feature Bonding. Robin3D consistently outperforms previous methods across five widely-used 3D multimodal learning benchmarks, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, we achieve a 7.8\% improvement in the grounding task (Multi3DRefer) and a 6.9\% improvement in the captioning task (Scan2Cap).
