- **Abstrat**: We introduce ChatGarment, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to automate the estimation, generation, and editing of 3D garments from images or text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications. Code and data will be available at https://chatgarment.github.io/.

- **Abstrat**: With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.

- **Abstrat**: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising reasoning capabilities on text-rich images from charts, tables, and documents. However, the abundant text within such images may increase the model's sensitivity to language. This raises the need to evaluate LVLM performance on cross-lingual text-rich visual inputs, where the language in the image differs from the language of the instructions. To address this, we introduce XT-VQA (Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Question Answering), a benchmark designed to assess how LVLMs handle language inconsistency between image text and questions. XT-VQA integrates five existing text-rich VQA datasets and a newly collected dataset, XPaperQA, covering diverse scenarios that require faithful recognition and comprehension of visual information despite language inconsistency. Our evaluation of prominent LVLMs on XT-VQA reveals a significant drop in performance for cross-lingual scenarios, even for models with multilingual capabilities. A mutual information analysis suggests that this performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately activate relevant visual information. To mitigate this issue, we propose MVCL-MI (Maximization of Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information), where a visual-text cross-lingual alignment is built by maximizing mutual information between the model's outputs and visual information. This is achieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher. Experimental results on the XT-VQA demonstrate that MVCL-MI effectively reduces the visual-text cross-lingual performance disparity while preserving the inherent capabilities of LVLMs, shedding new light on the potential practice for improving LVLMs. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Stardust-y/XTVQA.git





## PepTune: De Novo Generation of Therapeutic Peptides with Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Diffusion

- **Abstrat**: Peptide therapeutics, a major class of medicines, have achieved remarkable success across diseases such as diabetes and cancer, with landmark examples such as GLP-1 receptor agonists revolutionizing the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug development and structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.

- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions.

- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in Natural Language Processing and coding, yet they struggle with robustness and accuracy in complex function calls. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces ADC, an innovative approach that enhances LLMs' ability to follow function formats and match complex parameters. ADC utilizes a high-quality code fine-tuning dataset with line-level execution feedback, providing granular process supervision that fosters strong logical reasoning and adherence to function formats. It also employs an adversarial dataset generation process to improve parameter matching. The staged training methodology capitalizes on both enriched code datasets and refined adversarial datasets, leading to marked improvements in function calling capabilities on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Benchmark. The innovation of ADC lies in its strategic combination of process supervision, adversarial refinement, and incremental learning, setting a new standard for LLM proficiency in complex function calling.
