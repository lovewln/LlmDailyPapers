- **Abstrat**: Answering questions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) still lacks a systematic assessment and in-depth investigation. In this paper, we introduce MME-CoT, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three novel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs, uncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mmecot.github.io/

- **Abstrat**: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to overcome the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

## Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13904v3
- **Authors**: ['Linh Tran', 'Wei Sun', 'Stacy Patterson', 'Ana Milanova']
- **Abstrat**: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.





## Human-LLM Coevolution: Evidence from Academic Writing
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09606v1
- **Authors**: ['Mingmeng Geng', 'Roberto Trotta']
- **Abstrat**: With a statistical analysis of arXiv paper abstracts, we report a marked drop in the frequency of several words previously identified as overused by ChatGPT, such as "delve", starting soon after they were pointed out in early 2024. The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency.





## Do LLMs Recognize Your Preferences? Evaluating Personalized Preference Following in LLMs
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09597v1
- **Authors**: ['Siyan Zhao', 'Mingyi Hong', 'Yang Liu', 'Devamanyu Hazarika', 'Kaixiang Lin']
- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as chatbots, yet their ability to personalize responses to user preferences remains limited. We introduce PrefEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to infer, memorize and adhere to user preferences in a long-context conversational setting. PrefEval comprises 3,000 manually curated user preference and query pairs spanning 20 topics. PrefEval contains user personalization or preference information in both explicit and implicit forms, and evaluates LLM performance using a generation and a classification task. With PrefEval, we evaluated the aforementioned preference following capabilities of 10 open-source and proprietary LLMs in multi-session conversations with varying context lengths up to 100k tokens. We benchmark with various prompting, iterative feedback, and retrieval-augmented generation methods. Our benchmarking effort reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs face significant challenges in proactively following users' preferences during conversations. In particular, in zero-shot settings, preference following accuracy falls below 10% at merely 10 turns (~3k tokens) across most evaluated models. Even with advanced prompting and retrieval methods, preference following still deteriorates in long-context conversations. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning on PrefEval significantly improves performance. We believe PrefEval serves as a valuable resource for measuring, understanding, and enhancing LLMs' preference following abilities, paving the way for personalized conversational agents. Our code and dataset are available at https://prefeval.github.io/.





## KIMAs: A Configurable Knowledge Integrated Multi-Agent System

- **Abstrat**: Knowledge-intensive conversations supported by large language models (LLMs) have become one of the most popular and helpful applications that can assist people in different aspects. Many current knowledge-intensive applications are centered on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. While many open-source RAG frameworks facilitate the development of RAG-based applications, they often fall short in handling practical scenarios complicated by heterogeneous data in topics and formats, conversational context management, and the requirement of low-latency response times. This technical report presents a configurable knowledge integrated multi-agent system, KIMAs, to address these challenges. KIMAs features a flexible and configurable system for integrating diverse knowledge sources with 1) context management and query rewrite mechanisms to improve retrieval accuracy and multi-turn conversational coherency, 2) efficient knowledge routing and retrieval, 3) simple but effective filter and reference generation mechanisms, and 4) optimized parallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution. Our work provides a scalable framework for advancing the deployment of LLMs in real-world settings. To show how KIMAs can help developers build knowledge-intensive applications with different scales and emphases, we demonstrate how we configure the system to three applications already running in practice with reliable performance.





## Logical forms complement probability in understanding language model (and human) performance
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09589v1
- **Authors**: ['Yixuan Wang', 'Freda Shi']
- **Abstrat**: With the increasing interest in using large language models (LLMs) for planning in natural language, understanding their behaviors becomes an important research question. This work conducts a systematic investigation of LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance. Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical forms should be considered as orthogonal factors. In addition, we show similarities and differences between the logical reasoning performances of humans and LLMs by comparing LLM and human behavioral results.





## Polymind: Parallel Visual Diagramming with Large Language Models to Support Prewriting Through Microtasks
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09577v1
- **Authors**: ['Qian Wan', 'Jiannan Li', 'Huanchen Wang', 'Zhicong Lu']
- **Abstrat**: Prewriting is the process of generating and organising ideas before a first draft. It consists of a combination of informal, iterative, and semi-structured strategies such as visual diagramming, which poses a challenge for collaborating with large language models (LLMs) in a turn-taking conversational manner. We present Polymind, a visual diagramming tool that leverages multiple LLM-powered agents to support prewriting. The system features a parallel collaboration workflow in place of the turn-taking conversational interactions. It defines multiple ``microtasks'' to simulate group collaboration scenarios such as collaborative writing and group brainstorming. Instead of repetitively prompting a chatbot for various purposes, Polymind enables users to orchestrate multiple microtasks simultaneously. Users can configure and delegate customised microtasks, and manage their microtasks by specifying task requirements and toggling visibility and initiative. Our evaluation revealed that, compared to ChatGPT, users had more customizability over collaboration with Polymind, and were thus able to quickly expand personalised writing ideas during prewriting.





## Zero-shot generation of synthetic neurosurgical data with large language models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09566v1
- **Authors**: ['Austin A. Barr', 'Eddie Guo', 'Emre Sezgin']
- **Abstrat**: Clinical data is fundamental to advance neurosurgical research, but access is often constrained by data availability, small sample sizes, privacy regulations, and resource-intensive preprocessing and de-identification procedures. Synthetic data offers a potential solution to challenges associated with accessing and using real-world data (RWD). This study aims to evaluate the capability of zero-shot generation of synthetic neurosurgical data with a large language model (LLM), GPT-4o, by benchmarking with the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). Synthetic datasets were compared to real-world neurosurgical data to assess fidelity (means, proportions, distributions, and bivariate correlations), utility (ML classifier performance on RWD), and privacy (duplication of records from RWD). The GPT-4o-generated datasets matched or exceeded CTGAN performance, despite no fine-tuning or access to RWD for pre-training. Datasets demonstrated high univariate and bivariate fidelity to RWD without directly exposing any real patient records, even at amplified sample size. Training an ML classifier on GPT-4o-generated data and testing on RWD for a binary prediction task showed an F1 score (0.706) with comparable performance to training on the CTGAN data (0.705) for predicting postoperative functional status deterioration. GPT-4o demonstrated a promising ability to generate high-fidelity synthetic neurosurgical data. These findings also indicate that data synthesized with GPT-4o can effectively augment clinical data with small sample sizes, and train ML models for prediction of neurosurgical outcomes. Further investigation is necessary to improve the preservation of distributional characteristics and boost classifier performance.





## MDCrow: Automating Molecular Dynamics Workflows with Large Language Models
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09565v1
- **Authors**: ['Quintina Campbell', 'Sam Cox', 'Jorge Medina', 'Brittany Watterson', 'Andrew D. White']
- **Abstrat**: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding biomolecular systems but remain challenging to automate. Recent advances in large language models (LLM) have demonstrated success in automating complex scientific tasks using LLM-based agents. In this paper, we introduce MDCrow, an agentic LLM assistant capable of automating MD workflows. MDCrow uses chain-of-thought over 40 expert-designed tools for handling and processing files, setting up simulations, analyzing the simulation outputs, and retrieving relevant information from literature and databases. We assess MDCrow's performance across 25 tasks of varying required subtasks and difficulty, and we evaluate the agent's robustness to both difficulty and prompt style. \texttt{gpt-4o} is able to complete complex tasks with low variance, followed closely by \texttt{llama3-405b}, a compelling open-source model. While prompt style does not influence the best models' performance, it has significant effects on smaller models.





## Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos

- **Authors**: ['Haobo Yuan', 'Xiangtai Li', 'Tao Zhang', 'Zilong Huang', 'Shilin Xu', 'Shunping Ji', 'Yunhai Tong', 'Lu Qi', 'Jiashi Feng', 'Ming-Hsuan Yang']
- **Abstrat**: This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.





## EmbodiedBench: Comprehensive Benchmarking Multi-modal Large Language Models for Vision-Driven Embodied Agents

- **Abstrat**: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 13 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents.

## TransMLA: Multi-Head Latent Attention Is All You Need
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07864v2
- **Authors**: ['Fanxu Meng', 'Zengwei Yao', 'Muhan Zhang']
- **Abstrat**: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce TransMLA, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.
