- **Abstrat**: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.





## Information Theory of Meaningful Communication

- **Abstrat**: In Shannon's seminal paper, entropy of printed English, treated as a stationary stochastic process, was estimated to be roughly 1 bit per character. However, considered as a means of communication, language differs considerably from its printed form: (i) the units of information are not characters or even words but clauses, i.e. shortest meaningful parts of speech; and (ii) what is transmitted is principally the meaning of what is being said or written, while the precise phrasing that was used to communicate the meaning is typically ignored. In this study, we show that one can leverage recently developed large language models to quantify information communicated in meaningful narratives in terms of bits of meaning per clause.

- **Abstrat**: Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) systems have demonstrated impressive vision-language reasoning capabilities but suffer from pervasive and severe hallucination issues, posing significant risks in critical domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems. Despite previous efforts to mitigate hallucinations, a persistent issue remains: visual defect from vision-language misalignment, creating a bottleneck in visual processing capacity. To address this challenge, we develop Complementary Adaptive Token-level Contrastive Decoding to Mitigate Hallucinations in LVLMs (CATCH), based on the Information Bottleneck theory. CATCH introduces Complementary Visual Decoupling (CVD) for visual information separation, Non-Visual Screening (NVS) for hallucination detection, and Adaptive Token-level Contrastive Decoding (ATCD) for hallucination mitigation. CATCH addresses issues related to visual defects that cause diminished fine-grained feature perception and cumulative hallucinations in open-ended scenarios. It is applicable to various visual question-answering tasks without requiring any specific data or prior knowledge, and generalizes robustly to new tasks without additional training, opening new possibilities for advancing LVLM in various challenging applications.





## Strengthening Fake News Detection: Leveraging SVM and Sophisticated Text Vectorization Techniques. Defying BERT?
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12703v1

- **Abstrat**: The rapid spread of misinformation, particularly through online platforms, underscores the urgent need for reliable detection systems. This study explores the utilization of machine learning and natural language processing, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and BERT, to detect news that are fake. We employ three distinct text vectorization methods for SVM: Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec, and Bag of Words (BoW) evaluating their effectiveness in distinguishing between genuine and fake news. Additionally, we compare these methods against the transformer large language model, BERT. Our comprehensive approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, rigorous model implementation, and thorough evaluation to determine the most effective techniques. The results demonstrate that while BERT achieves superior accuracy with 99.98% and an F1-score of 0.9998, the SVM model with a linear kernel and BoW vectorization also performs exceptionally well, achieving 99.81% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9980. These findings highlight that, despite BERT's superior performance, SVM models with BoW and TF-IDF vectorization methods come remarkably close, offering highly competitive performance with the advantage of lower computational requirements.





## When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through Model-Generated Explanations

- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where hidden triggers can maliciously manipulate model behavior. While several backdoor attack methods have been proposed, the mechanisms by which backdoor functions operate in LLMs remain underexplored. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and investigate backdoor functionality through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-understandable explanations for their decisions, allowing us to compare explanations for clean and poisoned samples. We explore various backdoor attacks and embed the backdoor into LLaMA models for multiple tasks. Our experiments show that backdoored models produce higher-quality explanations for clean data compared to poisoned data, while generating significantly more consistent explanations for poisoned data than for clean data. We further analyze the explanation generation process, revealing that at the token level, the explanation token of poisoned samples only appears in the final few transformer layers of the LLM. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention from the input context when generating the explanation. These findings deepen our understanding of backdoor attack mechanisms in LLMs and offer a framework for detecting such vulnerabilities through explainability techniques, contributing to the development of more secure LLMs.
