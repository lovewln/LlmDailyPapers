- **Abstrat**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern software systems, interfacing between the user and the Internet to assist with tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected into external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction.   To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference optimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with prompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate instruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We then perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer the secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method that reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to around 0%, even against attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This indicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks. Also, our defended models are still practical with similar utility to the one before our defensive training.

- **Abstrat**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven highly effective for enhancing complex reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet, it struggles in complex spatial reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, human cognition extends beyond language alone, enabling the remarkable capability to think in both words and images. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose a new reasoning paradigm, Multimodal Visualization-of-Thought (MVoT). It enables visual thinking in MLLMs by generating image visualizations of their reasoning traces. To ensure high-quality visualization, we introduce token discrepancy loss into autoregressive MLLMs. This innovation significantly improves both visual coherence and fidelity. We validate this approach through several dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. Experimental results reveal that MVoT demonstrates competitive performance across tasks. Moreover, it exhibits robust and reliable improvements in the most challenging scenarios where CoT fails. Ultimately, MVoT establishes new possibilities for complex reasoning tasks where visual thinking can effectively complement verbal reasoning.

- **Abstrat**: Recent accelerations in multi-modal applications have been made possible with the plethora of image and text data available online. However, the scarcity of analogous data in the medical field, specifically in histopathology, has slowed comparable progress. To enable similar representation learning for histopathology, we turn to YouTube, an untapped resource of videos, offering $1,087$ hours of valuable educational histopathology videos from expert clinicians. From YouTube, we curate QUILT: a large-scale vision-language dataset consisting of $802, 144$ image and text pairs. QUILT was automatically curated using a mixture of models, including large language models, handcrafted algorithms, human knowledge databases, and automatic speech recognition. In comparison, the most comprehensive datasets curated for histopathology amass only around $200$K samples. We combine QUILT with datasets from other sources, including Twitter, research papers, and the internet in general, to create an even larger dataset: QUILT-1M, with $1$M paired image-text samples, marking it as the largest vision-language histopathology dataset to date. We demonstrate the value of QUILT-1M by fine-tuning a pre-trained CLIP model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on both zero-shot and linear probing tasks for classifying new histopathology images across $13$ diverse patch-level datasets of $8$ different sub-pathologies and cross-modal retrieval tasks.





## ML Mule: Mobile-Driven Context-Aware Collaborative Learning

- **Abstrat**: Artificial intelligence has been integrated into nearly every aspect of daily life, powering applications from object detection with computer vision to large language models for writing emails and compact models in smart homes. These machine learning models cater to individual users but are often detached from them, as they are typically stored and processed in centralized data centers. This centralized approach raises privacy concerns, incurs high infrastructure costs, and struggles with personalization. Federated and fully decentralized learning methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they still depend on centralized servers or face slow convergence due to communication constraints. To overcome these challenges, we propose ML Mule, a approach that utilizes individual mobile devices as 'Mules' to train and transport model snapshots as they move through physical spaces, sharing these models with the physical 'Spaces' they inhabit. This method implicitly forms affinity groups among devices associated with users who share particular spaces, enabling collaborative model evolution, and protecting users' privacy. Our approach addresses several major shortcomings of traditional, federated, and fully decentralized learning systems. The proposed framework represents a new class of machine learning methods that are more robust, distributed, and personalized, bringing the field closer to realizing the original vision of intelligent, adaptive, and genuinely context-aware smart environments. The results show that ML Mule converges faster and achieves higher model accuracy compared to other existing methods.





## Investigating Large Language Models in Inferring Personality Traits from User Conversations

- **Abstrat**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating remarkable human like capabilities across diverse domains, including psychological assessment. This study evaluates whether LLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, can infer Big Five personality traits and generate Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) item scores from user conversations under zero-shot prompting conditions. Our findings reveal that incorporating an intermediate step--prompting for BFI-10 item scores before calculating traits--enhances accuracy and aligns more closely with the gold standard than direct trait inference. This structured approach underscores the importance of leveraging psychological frameworks in improving predictive precision. Additionally, a group comparison based on depressive symptom presence revealed differential model performance. Participants were categorized into two groups: those experiencing at least one depressive symptom and those without symptoms. GPT-4o mini demonstrated heightened sensitivity to depression-related shifts in traits such as Neuroticism and Conscientiousness within the symptom-present group, whereas GPT-4o exhibited strengths in nuanced interpretation across groups. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to analyze real-world psychological data effectively, offering a valuable foundation for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and psychology.
