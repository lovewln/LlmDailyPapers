- **Abstrat**: Structured image understanding, such as interpreting tables and charts, requires strategically refocusing across various structures and texts within an image, forming a reasoning sequence to arrive at the final answer. However, current multimodal large language models (LLMs) lack this multihop selective attention capability. In this work, we introduce ReFocus, a simple yet effective framework that equips multimodal LLMs with the ability to generate "visual thoughts" by performing visual editing on the input image through code, shifting and refining their visual focuses. Specifically, ReFocus enables multimodal LLMs to generate Python codes to call tools and modify the input image, sequentially drawing boxes, highlighting sections, and masking out areas, thereby enhancing the visual reasoning process. We experiment upon a wide range of structured image understanding tasks involving tables and charts. ReFocus largely improves performance on all tasks over GPT-4o without visual editing, yielding an average gain of 11.0% on table tasks and 6.8% on chart tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of the effects of different visual edits, and reasons why ReFocus can improve the performance without introducing additional information. Further, we collect a 14k training set using ReFocus, and prove that such visual chain-of-thought with intermediate information offers a better supervision than standard VQA data, reaching a 8.0% average gain over the same model trained with QA pairs and 2.6% over CoT.

- **Abstrat**: The ability to organically reason over and with both text and images is a pillar of human intelligence, yet the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform such multimodal reasoning remains under-explored. Existing benchmarks often emphasize text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, failing to adequately assess integrated visual and textual reasoning. We introduce EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning), a benchmark targeting organic multimodal reasoning across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding. EMMA tasks demand advanced cross-modal reasoning that cannot be addressed by reasoning independently in each modality, offering an enhanced test suite for MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on EMMA reveals significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time compute scaling underperforming. These findings underscore the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to close the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodality.





## A survey of textual cyber abuse detection using cutting-edge language models and large language models

- **Authors**: ['Jose A. Diaz-Garcia', 'Joao Paulo Carvalho']
- **Abstrat**: The success of social media platforms has facilitated the emergence of various forms of online abuse within digital communities. This abuse manifests in multiple ways, including hate speech, cyberbullying, emotional abuse, grooming, and sexting. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the different forms of abuse prevalent in social media, with a particular focus on how emerging technologies, such as Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), are reshaping both the detection and generation of abusive content within these networks. We delve into the mechanisms through which social media abuse is perpetuated, exploring the psychological and social impact. Additionally, we examine the dual role of advanced language models-highlighting their potential to enhance automated detection systems for abusive behavior while also acknowledging their capacity to generate harmful content. This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on online safety and ethics, offering insights into the evolving landscape of cyberabuse and the technological innovations that both mitigate and exacerbate it.





## AgroGPT: Efficient Agricultural Vision-Language Model with Expert Tuning

- **Abstrat**: Significant progress has been made in advancing large multimodal conversational models (LMMs), capitalizing on vast repositories of image-text data available online. Despite this progress, these models often encounter substantial domain gaps, hindering their ability to engage in complex conversations across new domains. Recent efforts have aimed to mitigate this issue, albeit relying on domain-specific image-text data to curate instruction-tuning data. However, many domains, such as agriculture, lack such vision-language data. In this work, we propose an approach to construct instruction-tuning data that harnesses vision-only data for the agriculture domain. We utilize diverse agricultural datasets spanning multiple domains, curate class-specific information, and employ large language models (LLMs) to construct an expert-tuning set, resulting in a 70k expert-tuning dataset called AgroInstruct. Subsequently, we expert-tuned and created AgroGPT, an efficient LMM that can hold complex agriculture-related conversations and provide useful insights. We also develop AgroEvals for evaluation and compare {AgroGPT's} performance with large open and closed-source models. {AgroGPT} excels at identifying fine-grained agricultural concepts, can act as an agriculture expert, and provides helpful information for multimodal agriculture questions. The code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/awaisrauf/agroGPT.





## Using LLMs to Infer Non-Binary COVID-19 Sentiments of Chinese Micro-bloggers
- **Url**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05423v1
- **Authors**: ['Jerry Chongyi Hu', 'Mohammed Shahid Modi', 'Boleslaw K. Szymanski']
- **Abstrat**: Studying public sentiment during crises is crucial for understanding how opinions and sentiments shift, resulting in polarized societies. We study Weibo, the most popular microblogging site in China, using posts made during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. The study period includes the pre-COVID-19 stage, the outbreak stage, and the early stage of epidemic prevention. We use Llama 3 8B, a Large Language Model, to analyze users' sentiments on the platform by classifying them into positive, negative, sarcastic, and neutral categories. Analyzing sentiment shifts on Weibo provides insights into how social events and government actions influence public opinion. This study contributes to understanding the dynamics of social sentiments during health crises, fulfilling a gap in sentiment analysis for Chinese platforms. By examining these dynamics, we aim to offer valuable perspectives on digital communication's role in shaping society's responses during unprecedented global challenges.
